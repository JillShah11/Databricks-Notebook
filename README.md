README: Silver to Gold Layer Transformation with Databricks and PySpark

Overview

This project outlines the process of transforming data from the Silver layer to the Gold layer using Databricks with PySpark. The data is refined, aggregated, and structured for business reporting in Azure SQL Database. The solution incorporates:

PySpark for Transformation Logic

External Tables and External Sources

Views for Enhanced Data Management

CETAS (Create External Table As Select) for Optimized Data Loading

Architecture

Data Flow Overview

Source (Silver Layer): Data cleaned and structured using Databricks (PySpark).

Transformation: Data is aggregated, filtered, and refined using PySpark with SQL commands.

Destination (Gold Layer): Data loaded into Azure SQL Database using CETAS for efficient bulk data movement.

Views: Created on top of the Silver layer for simplified querying and integration with Gold Layer tables.

Components

1. Databricks Notebook (PySpark)

Handles data transformations directly in PySpark.

Utilizes SQL commands for data manipulation.

2. External Tables and Sources

External Tables in Azure SQL Database are configured to reference data in ADLS.

This approach enables seamless data movement between ADLS and SQL Server without data duplication.

3. Views on Silver Layer

Views simplify complex queries and act as a logical data layer between Silver and Gold layers.

They ensure consistent data accessibility for downstream processes.

4. CETAS (Create External Table As Select)

CETAS optimizes data export to Azure SQL Database with efficient parallel writes.

Ensures high performance and scalability for large data volumes.

Key Features

✅ Efficient data transformation using PySpark for scalable processing.✅ Improved data accessibility via Views on the Silver layer.✅ Optimized data movement through CETAS to minimize latency.✅ Integration of external tables to maintain a flexible data structure.

Prerequisites

Databricks Workspace with PySpark configured.

Azure SQL Database with required permissions.

ADLS with Bronze and Silver layer data in place.

Appropriate network configurations for secure connectivity.

Deployment Steps

Create External Tables:

In Azure SQL Database, create external tables linked to ADLS.

Develop PySpark Transformation Logic:

Load data from the Silver layer.

Perform necessary data transformations (e.g., cleansing, deduplication, joins).

Create Views on Silver Layer:

Develop structured views in Azure SQL Database for simplified data access.

Implement CETAS:

Use CETAS in PySpark to efficiently write transformed data from the Silver layer to the Gold layer.

Testing and Validation:

Validate data integrity and schema consistency in the Gold layer.

Perform performance benchmarking to ensure efficient query execution.

Best Practices

Utilize partitioning in CETAS for improved query performance.

Employ Delta Lake format for Silver layer data to support version control.

Implement error handling and logging within Databricks notebooks.

Schedule pipelines with Databricks Jobs or Azure Data Factory for automated data processing.

Next Steps

Develop Power BI dashboards using Gold layer data for business insights.

Implement data governance policies for data security and access control.
