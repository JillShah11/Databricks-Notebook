# 🟡 Silver to Gold Layer Transformation with Databricks & PySpark

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the process of transforming data from the **Silver** layer to the **Gold** layer using **Databricks** and **PySpark**. The final transformed data is optimized for business intelligence reporting and loaded into **Azure SQL Database**.

Key technologies and strategies used:
- ⚙️ PySpark for scalable transformation logic  
- 📂 External Tables for seamless data integration  
- 🔍 Views for simplified data access  
- 🚀 CETAS (Create External Table As Select) for high-performance data loading

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### 🔄 Data Flow

1. **Source (Silver Layer)**  
   - Cleaned and structured data, prepared using Databricks and PySpark.

2. **Transformation**  
   - Data is filtered, deduplicated, aggregated, and enriched using PySpark and SQL commands.

3. **Destination (Gold Layer)**  
   - Transformed data is exported to Azure SQL Database using **CETAS**, enabling efficient parallel writes.

4. **Views**  
   - Created on top of Silver layer tables to simplify querying and promote reusability.

## 🔧 Components

### 1. Databricks Notebook (PySpark)
- Performs the core data transformation using PySpark and SQL.
- Handles cleansing, deduplication, joins, and aggregations.

### 2. External Tables & Sources
- External tables in **Azure SQL Database** are configured to point to data in **ADLS**.
- Enables seamless data access without data duplication.

### 3. Views on Silver Layer
- Serve as a logical layer between Silver and Gold.
- Help simplify complex queries and standardize data access.

### 4. CETAS (Create External Table As Select)
- Enables efficient, scalable, and parallelized export of transformed data to Azure SQL.
- Improves performance for large datasets.

## 🌟 Key Features

✅ Scalable transformation using PySpark  
✅ Easy and consistent data access via Views  
✅ High-performance data loading with CETAS  
✅ Flexible architecture using External Tables  

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

- 🧠 Databricks workspace with PySpark configured  
- 🗄️ Azure SQL Database with necessary permissions  
- 📁 ADLS (Azure Data Lake Storage) with Bronze and Silver layer data  
- 🔐 Proper network and firewall settings for secure connectivity  

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Create External Tables**
   - Define external tables in Azure SQL that reference ADLS paths.

2. **Develop Transformation Logic in Databricks**
   - Load Silver layer data and apply transformation logic (joins, filters, aggregates, etc.).

3. **Create Views on Silver Layer**
   - Build reusable views for downstream access and integration.

4. **Implement CETAS**
   - Use CETAS in Databricks to export transformed data to Azure SQL (Gold layer).

5. **Testing & Validation**
   - Ensure schema consistency, data accuracy, and query performance in the Gold layer.

## 🧠 Best Practices

- 📌 Use **partitioning** in CETAS for better performance.  
- 📊 Store Silver layer data in **Delta Lake** format for versioning and auditability.  
- 🛠️ Implement robust **error handling and logging** in notebooks.  
- ⏱️ Schedule transformation jobs using **Databricks Jobs** or **Azure Data Factory**.

## 📈 Next Steps

- Build **Power BI dashboards** on top of the Gold layer.  
- Define and apply **data governance policies** for secure and compliant data access.
